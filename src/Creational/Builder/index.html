<title>Wikipedia</title><h1>Builder Design Pattern</h1><p>The builder pattern is a design pattern designed to provide a flexible solution to various object creation problems in object-oriented programming.</p><h2>Overview</h2><p>The Builder design pattern is one of the GoF design patterns[1] that describe how to solve recurring design problems in object-oriented software.</p><br><p>The Builder design pattern solves problems like</p><ul><li>How can a class (the same construction process) create different representations of a complex object?</l1><li>How can a class that includes creating a complex object be simplified?</l1></ul><h2>Definition</h2><p>The intent of the Builder design pattern is to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation. By doing so, the same construction process can create different representations.[1]</p><h2>Advantages</h2><p>Advantages of the Builder pattern include:[3]</p><br><ol><li>Allows you to vary a product's internal representation.</l1><li>Encapsulates code for construction and representation.</l1><li>Provides control over steps of construction process.</l1></ol><br><h2>Disadvantages</h2><p>Disadvantages of the Builder pattern include:[3]</p><br><ul><li>A distinct ConcreteBuilder must be created for each type of product.</l1><li>Builder classes must be mutable.</l1><li>May hamper/complicate dependency injection.</l1></ul>
